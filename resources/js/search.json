Let's see if ltrace gives us more insights.","We receive a SIGILL, which is a signal that the program tried to execute an illegal instruction. I'd like to see the program in hexeditor to reveal more information.","Let's search in the hexeditor by pressing CTRL+ W and search for text string challenge, the argument we found in the first step.
